This is basically a repository that contains one of my best work done till date in SQL. It is basically a major project for a DBMS unit at Monash University.
The main software used is Oracle SQL Developer.
The artefacts include the source code as well as schematic diagrams incorporating essential elements of Data Warehouse like Fact Tables and Dimensions.
